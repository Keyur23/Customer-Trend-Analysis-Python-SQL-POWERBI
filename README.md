# Customer Trend Analysis Using Python, SQL, and Power BI

## Business Problem Statement
A leading retail company aims to better understand its customers’ shopping behavior to improve sales, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. There have been noticeable changes in purchasing patterns across demographics, product categories, and sales channels (online versus offline). The goal is to uncover factors such as discounts, reviews, seasons, or payment preferences that drive consumer decisions and repeat purchases.

### Key Business Question
**“How can the company leverage consumer shopping data to identify trends, improve customer engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?”**

## Dataset Summary

- **Rows:** 3,900  
- **Columns:** 18  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Customer demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status.
  - Purchase details: Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color.
  - Shopping behavior: Discount Applied, Promo Code Used, Review Rating, Frequency of Purchases, Shipping Type.
- **Missing Data:** 37 values in the "Review Rating" column.

---

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - Imputed missing values for "Review Rating" using the median rating by product category.
  - Renamed columns to snake_case for consistency.
  - Engineered new features such as age groups and purchase frequency.
- **Integration**: Loaded cleaned data into a PostgreSQL database for structured SQL analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis (SQL Insights)
Using SQL, we answered critical business questions:
1. **Revenue by Gender**: Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers.
2. **Top Products and Categories**: Identified the highest-rated and most-purchased products in each category.
3. **Customer Segments**:
   - Segmented customers into "New," "Returning," and "Loyal."
   - Observed key spending patterns by segment.
4. **Impact of Discounts**:
   - Found products most dependent on discounts for sales.
   - Identified discount users who generated above-average revenue.
5. **Effect of Subscription Status**: Measured spend and revenue differences between subscribers and non-subscribers.
6. **Shipping Choices**: Compared purchasing behavior of customers using standard vs. express shipping.
7. **Demographic Insights**: Analyzed revenue contribution by customer age groups.

### 3. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)
- Designed an interactive dashboard to provide stakeholders with key insights at a glance.
- Highlighted customer segments, revenue breakdowns, and actionable trends.

## Key Findings & Business Recommendations

### Findings:
- **High Revenue Segments**: Certain age groups and express-shipping users contribute significantly to revenue.
- **Discount Efficiency**: While discounts drive sales, they must be balanced against profit margins.
- **Customer Loyalty**: Loyal customers and subscribers spend significantly more over time.

### Recommendations:
1. **Boost Subscriptions**: Enhance subscription benefits to drive loyalty.
2. **Reward Repeat Buyers**: Develop loyalty programs to drive repeat purchases.
3. **Optimize Discount Strategies**: Balance sales boosts with margin protection.
4. **Product Campaigns**: Focus marketing on top-rated and top-selling products.
5. **Targeted Marketing**:
   - Prioritize high-revenue age groups.
   - Incentivize express-shipping users for additional purchases.
